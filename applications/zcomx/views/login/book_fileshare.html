    Releasing a book for filesharing means a CBZ file will be created and
    shared with others via two file sharing networks: bittorrent and direct
    connect.
    </p>
    <p>Before proceeding:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ensure the book is set as completed.</li>
        <li>If you want to use a custom indicia image, make sure it has been uploaded before
releasing the book for filesharing.</li>
    </ul>

        Releasing a book for filesharing has the following effect:
    </div>
    <div class="panel-body">
        <ul>
            <li>A CBZ file is created</li>
            <li>The file is added to the Direct Connect network</li>
            <li>A torrent is created for the file and the torrent is seeded</li>
            <li>The file is added to the torrent containing all books from the cartoonist</li>
            <li>The file is added to the torrent containing all books from zco.mx</li>
            <li>The book is locked from further modifications</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The process can take up to an hour if many images need to be resized to fit the CBZ format.</p>
