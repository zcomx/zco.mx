Book Reader Plugin
==================


Routing
-------

To read a book, use a url like:
    https://zco.mx/<cartoonist>/<book>/<page_no>

Example:
    https://zco.mx/FirstLast/MyBook/001         # first page
    https://zco.mx/FirstLast/MyBook/003         # third page

Routes defined in routes.py will redirect that url to the cartoonist page
passing the creator and passing the book_reader_url parameters.

For example:
    https://zco.mx/FirstLast/MyBook/001

routes to:
    https://zco.mx/index?creator=FirstLast&book_reader_url=/FirstLast/MyBook/001


Cartoonist Page
---------------

By default the cartoonist page displays details of the cartoonist.
For example:
    https://zco.mx/index?creator=FirstLast

If the book_reader_url parameter is provided, the cartoonist page is displayed
and the book reader plugin is initiated displaying the readable book over top
it. The book_reader_url indicates which book and which page to start on in the
reader plugin.

    https://zco.mx/index?creator=FirstLast&book_reader_url=/FirstLast/MyBook/001

If the book_reader_url parameter is provided:

    * The cartoonist page hides a 'Read' link for the book.
    * The reader plugin is applied to that link.
    * A click event is triggered on the link.
    * This creates an iframe, which is displayed over top cartoonist page.
    * The iframe src is set to the value of the book_reader_url parameter
        prefixed by /embed

When the book reader is closed, the iframe is hidden, revealing the cartoonist
page underneath.
