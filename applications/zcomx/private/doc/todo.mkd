VERSION 2 - Before Going Live
[x] Crowdfunding Idea
    [x] Hide 'contributions' section from front page for now
    [x] Hide 'cartoonists' -> 'remaining' column
    [x] Hide 'ongoing' -> 'remaining' column
    [x] Is there a 'remaining' column for 'release'?
    [x] Fix up FAQs
        [x] What do the sections on the front page mean?
            Remove 'contributions' paragraph:
                **contributions** - Readers can support cartoonists through
                contributions. zco.mx hopes to raise a set amount to support specific
                books, and these titles are listed by the minimum amount of money
                remaining for each goal.
        [x] How do the contributions work?
            Replace:
                The idea behind contributions is to promote a fun way for readers to
                connect with and support self-publishing cartoonists. zco.mx is
                not-for-profit, and all contributions go ''directly'' to cartoonists. If
                a reader really enjoys the comic, they can consider "voting with their
                money."

                Every page that a cartoonist uploads increases the total amount that
                zco.mx hopes to raise for that book by $10, and every dollar that a
                reader contributes lowers the remaining amount of that goal. When the
                goal is met, the book is removed from the contribution list â€” hooray!
                The book will still be available to read and download, and many books
                will be ongoing and may reappear when a new page is added.
            With:
                zco.mx is not-for-profit and all contributions go directly to
                cartoonists.

        On first load, no image is displayed.  Maybe it's timing out because
        there are so many images needed to load?

        Ideally we display the image the want as soon as we can and then
        load remaining images in the background.

    [ ] Metadata Input: Republication - serial (i)
        Including wording for anthologies
        ...[or stories from anthologies which were] previously published (online or paper)

    jane smith jones -> id: 999 -> zco.mx/jane_smith_jones
    jane smith -> id: 999 -> zco.mx/jane_smith_jones

    We should likely create a check to alert when this happens because
    1) the cartoonist could generate a ton of aliases
    2) the cartoonist could masquerade (fraud) as another cartoonist
