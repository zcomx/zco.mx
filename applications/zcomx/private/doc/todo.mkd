    ## name change
    jane smith jones -> id: 999 -> zco.mx/jane_smith_jones
    jane smith -> id: 999 -> zco.mx/jane_smith_jones

    We should likely create a check to alert when this happens because

    The main dev, Lin Rookie (rookiestudio@gmail.com), suggests guided view is
    possible with opencv but he believes the feature is not useful and it is a
