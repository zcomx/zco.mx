[ ] Login -> Release Model
    Now that we require the metadata to be used, I think this can be
    removed:
        "Edit the year of publication if necessary.  Published [2014]"
    It should be the 'To Year' in the metadata.

[ ] Login -> Book Edit -> Copyright Licence

[ ] Front Page/Book Page
    SB 2015-03-25 20:56  we should talk about this

VERSION 4
[ ] How to Handle Translations ?
[ ] login -> books -> edit
    Use inline Editing for metadata
[ ] Read Page -> Scroll
    12459 - how to paginate long gn's -- modulo 30?
[ ] login -> books page
    paginate 'released' and 'ongoing' books
[ ] Creator page -> Links to Cartoonist Articles/interviews?
[ ] Book page -> Links to Book Reviews ?

[ ] Tags (kids, by genre ??)
[ ] Front Page -> 12560 - store attributes in session and reuse
[ ] 12539 - Create aliases when users change their name
    jane smith -> id: 999 -> zco.mx/jane_smith
    ## name change
    jane smith jones -> id: 999 -> zco.mx/jane_smith_jones
    jane smith -> id: 999 -> zco.mx/jane_smith_jones

    We should likely create a check to alert when this happens because
    1) the cartoonist could generate a ton of aliases
    2) the cartoonist could masquerade (fraud) as another cartoonist
[ ] bug/feature/feedback tracker
    * public or developer only?
    * vote up/down
    * github's issue tracker?
    * does this need a separate page?  link in the footer?

    * could be many jobs in the queue
    * could have 'd' jobs -- output of these would be nice

[ ] Is re-releasing released books a problem?
    * use the upload modal with any read-only fields
    * update a version number on the indicia?
[ ] login -> books
    add iframe code for each book
    <embed/>
    <iframe/>
    SB 2014-08-29 11:24  This needs more thought
[-] Guided view using Perfect Viewer ?
    The main dev, Lin Rookie (rookiestudio@gmail.com), suggests guided
    view is possible with opencv but he believes the feature is not
    useful and it is a low priority.  He said the source is closed and
    he does not take bounties towards new features.
[ ] bio and book description - wikipedia api?
